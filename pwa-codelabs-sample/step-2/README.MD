A service worker is a event driven worker which runs in the background and sits in between your application and the browser. It can intercept and handle the network requests for the registered domain.

## Implementation

- Registering Service Worker
- Install Event - Adding the static resources to cache
- Activate Event Listener
- Fetch Event Listener

## Run to see the result

```bash
npm run server
```

Open [localhost:8000/step-2](http://localhost:8000/step-2) in your chrome browser.
